Getting up to speed:

App consists of two seperate wholes. 
  1) React app
  2) Java Spring Boot app
PostgreSQL is used as a database



1) FRONTEND
	Frontend part is developed using Javascript React.
	Developer needs to install node
	after cloning the repo, navigate to myapp. it is necessary to trigger 'npm install' so that all library and extensions are installed to your machine form the project.
	run the app using 'npm start' command 

2) BACKEND
	backend is developed in Java Spring Boot
	Install Java (at least 17)on your machine.
	Since it is Spring Boot for the sake of easy going use intelij and just click a button to start it.



For Tracking work we are using GitHub Projects.
Board is utilized but only with 'draft' items and not 'GitHub Issues' - we will not use issues
